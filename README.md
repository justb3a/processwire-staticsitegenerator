# ProcessWire Static Site Generator

Generates an entirely static website.

Tested with the following Template Engine: 

* [TemplateEngineFactory][tef]
* [TemplateEngineTwig][tet]

A static site can't offer interactive functionality such as a contact form or logins.  
There are some client-side options, but they have to be implemented explicitly.

[tet]:      http://modules.processwire.com/modules/template-engine-twig/    'TemplateEngineTwig'
